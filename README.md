## 🧠 **How Does It Work? Function Overview**

**Macro Builder**:  
Design actions visually or via natural text (e.g., “press F every 3 seconds and trigger a screenshot at 2-minute mark.”) The AI interprets and optimizes sequences for efficiency.

**Smart Action Prediction**:  
The AI observes your habit patterns (always looting after combat? Always alt-tabbing at match end?) and offers one-click macro suggestions.

**API Integration Functions**:  
OpenAI and Claude whisper to our engine—enabling you to auto-generate or refine macros (e.g., “create an endless jump combo macro for PlatformerX in Spanish”).

**Cross-Platform Macro Sync**:  
Personal macro sets persist across devices and operating systems. Never set up twice. Log in, and you’re ready to play anywhere.

**24/7 Live Support Function**:  
Instant chat portal inside the app; AI assistant provides documentation, troubleshooting, and submits support tickets—no human required, but always available.

**Privacy Controls**:  
Choose between pure local, hybrid, and cloud AI execution for macro analysis—privacy and flexibility by design.

**Event History and Macro Performance Analytics**:  
View macro performance in real-time, adjust with AI help, and watch your gameplay stats improve!
